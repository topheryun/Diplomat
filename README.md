# Diplomat

#Inspiration
We were brainstorming problems and one of us had just come back from a leadership program meeting that was about team building and smooth conflict resolution. The original idea was to ease the team-building process, but as we brainstormed we saw an opportunity for a third party to deliberately guide the conflict resolution process, kind of like a marriage therapist / counselor!

#What it does
So, if two parties(ex:- couples) are having trouble relationship with each other and are trying to resolve that issue through a Mediator so we provide them a base where they can find professional mediators and both party's will tell their perspectives and then the Mediator will get those info and try to resolve the problem.

#How we built it
We used broad range of Ide's and programming languages. Such as, we worked on VS CODE, ECLIPSE, IntellIIj IDEA, Webstorm, and SPRING. We focus on html, CSS, Typescript, and Java. We used Java and Spring Boot for the backend and the Angular Framework for the frontend.

#Challenges we ran into
Disparity of experience levels Connecting Google Cloud to Spring Boot VSCode configuration with Node JS Transferring Data between components in Angular

#Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud to have embarked on a journey to revolutionize conflict management.

#What we learned
Our two Freshman members learned version control, framework basics, IDE configuration, and how to best use Google through osmosis. The two more experienced members learned essential project management skills, and Angular as we developed Diplomat. We learned the scope of .our capabilities in a 24 hour period (this was three out of four of our team members' first hackathon)

#What's next for Diplomat
Fix Google Cloud functionality. Properly connect backend and front end components. Allow communication between mediators and users through voice/text chat. Complete the form to email message sending service. Connect to our domain name - diplomatarbiters.space
